            <p>
              Workforce Opportunity Services (WOS), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is
              dedicated to developing talent from local communities and
              underserved populations. Using a scientifically-based model, WOS
              recruits, trains, and places high-potential candidates with
              leading organizations through a unique consultant-to-employee
              pipeline. This process ensures individuals are fully integrated
              into a company's business and culture, providing a seamless bridge
              between consultancy and full-time employment. <br />
              Founded in 2005 by Dr. Art Langer, WOS originated from his
              research at Columbia University focused on leveling the playing
              field for those with limited access to opportunities. Dr. Langerâ€™s
              model emphasizes a blend of technical and interpersonal skills to
              ensure long-term career success. To date, this impactful approach
              has enabled WOS to serve over 7,500 individuals and partner with
              more than 75 major corporations worldwide, transforming lives
              while building better workforces.
